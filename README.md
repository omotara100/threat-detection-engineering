# Threat Detection Engineering

## Overview
This project demonstrates foundational threat detection engineering skills by translating attacker behaviors into Sigma detection rules. The focus is on identifying suspicious activity, reducing false positives, and validating detections using lab-generated logs.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Behavioral detection design
- Sigma rule creation
- Log validation
- Noise reduction
- MITRE ATT&CK alignment

## Detection Coverage
- Network scanning activity
- Suspicious PowerShell execution
- Unusual outbound network connections

## Tools Used
- Sysmon
- Windows Event Logs
- PowerShell
- Sigma
